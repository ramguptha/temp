        <h1 class="Heading1">Locking your mobile device or OS X computer</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can issue a command to remotely lock a  mobile device, or an OS X computer running version 10.10 and higher, making it unusable until the correct passcode or password is entered locally.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">If your mobile device does not have a passcode set, this command does not protect against unauthorized use as anyone can access the device with a simple swipe on the lock screen.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">The behavior of this command is slightly different depending on the operating system of your device:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">With Android devices, you have the option of locking the device with a new passcode if one is not currently present.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">With iOS devices that have a passcode set, you have the option of displaying a message and a contact phone number on the lock screen of the device.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">With OS X computers, you are prompted to set a
password that must be entered locally on the computer to unlock it. Unlocking the computer without this password is possible only by contacting Apple.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To lock your mobile device:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">In the My Devices sidebar, select the mobile device that you want to lock.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">From the Commands menu, click <span class="Bold">Lock Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Depending on your device, you may have one of the following options:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●">If you are locking an iOS device that has a passcode set and you want to display a message or contact phone number on the device's lock screen, enter them in the fields provided.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●">If you are locking an Android device without a passcode and you want to set one, enter and confirm the new passcode in the fields provided.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Lock</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To lock your OS&#160;X computer with a password:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">In the My Devices sidebar, select the OS X computer that you want to lock.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">From the Commands menu, click <span class="Bold">Lock Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Enter and confirm the password that must be entered locally on the computer to unlock it.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">This password must be exactly six characters long. Keep the password in a secure location: without it, your computer can only be accessed
by contacting Apple.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Lock</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
