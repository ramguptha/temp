        <h1 class="Heading1">Erasing your mobile device or OS X computer</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can issue a command to remotely erase a mobile device or an OS X computer running version 10.10 and higher.</p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum="WARNING! &#160;&#160;">This action is not reversible. You cannot recover the erased information from your mobile device or computer (although recovering data from a backup system, if one exists within your organization, may be possible). Because this command may have serious and irreversible consequences, make sure you understand these
consequences before proceeding. If you are not sure whether you need to erase your mobile device or computer, contact your IT&#160;administrator.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you erase a mobile device, all user data on the device is erased along with all applications you have installed, effectively resetting the device to its factory condition.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you erase an OS&#160;X computer, all data from all writable internal and
external drives, including the
operating system, applications, and user data, is erased. In addition, the computer is locked to prevent any further access until a special
password that you set is entered locally on the computer. Unlocking the computer without this password is possible only by contacting Apple.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To erase your mobile device:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">In the My Devices sidebar, select the mobile device that you want to erase.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">From the Commands menu, click <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">If your mobile device has an internal SD&#160;card, you are prompted to select one of the following options:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Erase internal storage only</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Erase internal storage and SD card</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Important_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="IMPORTANT &#160;&#160;">Clicking <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span> issues the command to erase your mobile device, which you cannot reverse.</p>

by contacting Apple.</p>
