        <h1 class="Heading1">Setting login and language preferences</h1>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing"> The Self-Service Portal can remember certain preferences you set on the login page, even after you log out of the application and close your browser.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">If your browser is set to reject cookies, your preferences cannot be saved. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Saving login information</h2>
        <p class="Body">To avoid entering your login information each time you log in to the Self-Service Portal from the same computer, select the <span class="Bold">Remember Me</span> checkbox on the login page. These details are saved until your browser's cookies are deleted; however, you must still enter your password to log in.</p>
        <p class="Body">To remove your saved login information, clear the <span class="Bold">Remember Me</span> checkbox before you log in.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Setting your language preference</h2>
        <p class="Body">When you first visit the login page, the Self-Service Portal is displayed in the default language set for your browser. If the Self-Service Portal does not support your browser's default language, English is used instead.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you prefer to use a different language than the default, you can easily switch by selecting an available language from the dropdown list on the login page.</p>
