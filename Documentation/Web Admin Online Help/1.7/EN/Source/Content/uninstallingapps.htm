        <h1 class="Heading1">Uninstalling Applications on Devices</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can send a command to remotely uninstall applications from mobile devices. This command is available only for iOS&#160;devices running iOS 5 or higher, and Android devices.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">Your ability to uninstall applications varies according to a device's operating system:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">On iOS  devices, you can uninstall only managed applications; that is,
applications that have been installed through Absolute
Manage.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">On Android devices, you can uninstall any application, but the
device's user must confirm the application's removal. However, if the device supports persistence,
user confirmation is not required.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you issue the command, the uninstall process begins as soon as the device next contacts the notification server of its OS vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action is
usually carried out within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network. On Android devices, a confirmation alert is shown before the
application is actually removed. If the user does not allow the removal,
the application remains on the device.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To uninstall applications on a mobile device:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the device you want to uninstall applications from. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All Mobile Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for a specific device</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the results grid, click the device.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Click the device's <span class="Bold">Applications</span> tab.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Select the checkbox of each application you want to uninstall.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">To quickly find specific applications, you can use the search field to narrow the applications listed by specific criteria (for example, by name or version number).</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <img src="Resources/Images/remove-button.png" class="Icon" />.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="6. ">Click <span class="Bold">Uninstall Applications</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="7. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">You may need to click your browser's refresh button to see updated information in the results grid.</p>
