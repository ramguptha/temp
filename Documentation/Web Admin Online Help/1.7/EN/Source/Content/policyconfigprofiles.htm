        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with Configuration Profiles Inside a Policy</h1>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">You can use configuration profiles within a policy in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Make configuration profiles available for on-demand installation by users of mobile devices that belong to the policy (iOS&#160;and Android devices only)</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Automatically install configuration profiles on mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Prohibit the installation of configuration profiles on mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Body">Before you can add a configuration profile to a policy from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, you must import or create the profile using the Absolute Manage Admin interface. For more information, see "Working with configuration profiles" in the <span class="Emphasis">Absolute Manage User Guide</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Policy actions take place on any mobile device belonging to the
policy as soon as the device contacts the notification server of its OS&#160;vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action usually takes place within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">It is possible to use the same configuration profile inside multiple policies in conflicting ways. For example, a device could belong to one policy where the profile is auto-installed and to another policy where the profile is
forbidden.
 Since
there is no way to satisfy both policies’ requirements at the same time, Absolute Manage uses the following hierarchy for carrying out profile actions, where higher entries take precedence over lower entries:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Forbidden</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Auto-install</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">On-demand</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Auto-remove</p>
        <p class="Body">For example, if a
configuration profile is auto-installed in one policy that a mobile device
belongs to and forbidden in another, the profile is not available on the
device because the “forbidden” category has a higher priority than
“auto-install”.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">Only one configuration profile (that is, the Exchange ActiveSync policy) can be active on a
Windows Phone device at any time. As a result, profiles are not installed on Windows Phone devices when the Absolute Manage policies that the devices belong to specify more than one profile as
automatically installed.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you add a configuration profile to a policy, you cannot edit the profile's assignment properties within the policy. If you want to edit these properties, you must remove the configuration profile from the policy and re-add it using the desired properties.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Removing Configuration Profiles from a Policy</h2>
        <p class="Body">When you remove a configuration profile from a policy, there is no immediate effect on
the mobile devices that belong to the policy. That is, when you remove a
profile that is set to "auto-install", it is not removed from the
policy's devices, and when you remove a profile that is set to "forbidden", it is
not installed on the policy's devices.
However, the restrictions placed on mobile devices with respect to the
configuration profile are lifted: the user can now remove a previously required profile or install a previously prohibited profile.</p>
