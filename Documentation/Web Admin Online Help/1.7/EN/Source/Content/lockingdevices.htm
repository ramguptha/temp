        <h1 class="Heading1">Locking Devices</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can issue a command to remotely lock mobile devices, rendering them unusable until a passcode is entered locally (unless a passcode has not been set on a device). This command is available for iOS&#160;and Android devices only.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you issue the command, a device is locked as soon as it next contacts the notification server of its OS vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action is
usually carried out within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network.</p>
        <p class="Body">With Android devices, you have the option to lock the device using a new passcode that you choose.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To lock mobile devices:</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the devices you want to lock. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All Mobile Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for specific devices</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the results grid, select the checkbox of the devices you want to lock and click <span class="Bold">Commands</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">Lock Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also issue the command for a single device from its Device Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the device you want to lock. The device's Device Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) "> From the Commands sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Device Lock</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">If you want to lock an Android device using a new passcode, enter and confirm the passcode in the fields provided (leave these fields empty if you do not want to set a new passcode on the device).</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">If the configuration profile on the device requires a
passcode, the user is prompted to create a new passcode if you do not
specify one here.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Lock</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
