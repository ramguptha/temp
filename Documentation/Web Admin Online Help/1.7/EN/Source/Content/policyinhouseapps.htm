        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with In-House Applications Inside a Policy</h1>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">For iOS&#160;and Android devices, you can use in-house applications within a policy in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Make in-house applications available for on-demand installation by users of mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Automatically install in-house applications on mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Prohibit the installation of in-house applications on mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Body">Before you can add an in-house application to a policy from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, you must import the application file as a mobile application package using the Absolute Manage Admin interface. For more information, see "Installing software on mobile devices" in the <span class="Emphasis">Absolute Manage User Guide</span>.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">Depending on the operating system of the mobile device, the user may need to confirm the installation or removal of applications:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●"> Silent installation (the application is installed without user confirmation) is supported on some Samsung Galaxy devices</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Silent removal (the application is removed without user confirmation) is supported on some Samsung Galaxy devices and devices running iOS 5 or higher (only for applications installed through Absolute Manage)</p>
        <p class="Body">Policy actions take place on any mobile device belonging to the
policy as soon as the device contacts the notification server of its OS&#160;vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action usually takes place within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network. With on-demand installation of applications, you can <a href="sendingmessages.htm">send a message</a> to or email the users of the devices to notify them of
the availability of a new application.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you add an in-house application to a policy, you cannot edit the application's assignment properties within the policy. If you want to edit these properties, you must remove the application from the policy and re-add it using the desired properties.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding In-House Applications to a Policy</h2>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To add in-house applications to a policy:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to the <span class="Bold">Mobile Policies</span> area.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Click the policy that you want to add in-house applications to.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Click the <span class="Bold">In-house Applications</span> tab.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">In the work area toolbar, click <span class="Bold">Add In-House Application</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Select the checkbox of each in-house application you want to add to the policy.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">To quickly find specific applications, you can use the search field to narrow the applications listed by specific criteria (for example, by application name or version number).</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="6. ">From the <span class="Bold">Assignment Rule</span> list, select how you want to manage the selected applications on devices belonging to the policy:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Auto-install</span>: The application is installed when a device enters
the policy. The application remains on the device when it leaves the
policy, and the device's user can manually delete the application, if desired.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">On-demand</span>: The application is made available within AbsoluteApps and the device's user can manually install the application.
The application remains on the device when it leaves the policy, and the device's user can
manually delete the application, if desired.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Auto-install, Auto-remove</span>: The application is installed when the
device enters the policy and removed when it leaves.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">On-demand, Auto-remove</span>: The application is made available within AbsoluteApps and the device's user can manually install the application. The application is removed when the device leaves the policy.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1ProcedureLast" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Forbidden</span>: The application cannot be installed on devices belonging to the policy.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">For information about on-demand installation on iOS devices,
please contact <a href="http://www.absolute.com/en/support" target="_blank" class="Hyperlink">Absolute Global Support</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="7. ">If you want the policy to restrict the availability of the selected applications to certain dates or times, select the <span class="Bold">Set availability time</span> checkbox, then choose one of the following options:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Every day between</span>: The application is
available to mobile devices belonging to this policy only during a certain
time of the day (for example, during office hours). Specify the start and end times in the available fields.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1ProcedureLast" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">From</span>: The application is available to mobile devices belonging to this policy only during a specific time period. Specify the start date and time as well as the end date and time.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">Use your local time in these fields. Times you enter are converted to and stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on the Absolute Manage server. As a result, you should take into account any time
differences that may exist with your mobile clients. You also must
manually compensate for Daylight Saving Time (DST), if desired,
because DST does not apply to UTC.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="8. ">Click <span class="Bold">Add to Policy</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="9. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Removing In-House Applications from a Policy</h2>
        <p class="Body">When you remove an application from a policy, there is no immediate effect on
the mobile devices that belong to the policy. That is, when you remove an application that is set to "auto-install", it is not removed from the
policy's devices, and when you remove an application that is set to "forbidden", it is
not installed on the policy's devices.
However, the restrictions placed on mobile devices with respect to the
application are lifted: the user can now remove a previously required application or install a previously prohibited application.</p>
