        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with Actions Inside a Policy</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can use actions within a smart policy to specify tasks that should be automatically performed
on mobile devices when they join the policy. You cannot use actions with standard policies.</p>
        <p class="Body">Actions must already be available within the <a href="workingwithactions.htm">Assignable Items &gt; Actions</a> area before you can add them to a smart policy.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you add an action to a smart policy, the action is carried out on all mobile devices that are
currently a member of the policy as soon as the devices contact the notification server of their OS&#160;vendor. If
a device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action usually takes place within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network. Actions are also carried out on each mobile device
that joins the smart policy in the future.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding Actions to a Smart Policy</h2>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To add actions to a smart policy:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to the <span class="Bold">Mobile Policies</span> area.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Click the smart policy that you want to add actions to.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Click the <span class="Bold">Actions</span> tab.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">In the work area toolbar, click <span class="Bold">Add Actions to Policy</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Select the checkbox of each action you want to add to the smart policy.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">To quickly find specific actions, you can use the search field to narrow the actions listed by specific criteria (for example, by action name).</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="6. ">Specify whether you want to delay or repeat the action:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●">Select <span class="Bold">Action start delay</span> if you do not want the action to be performed
immediately when a mobile device joins the
smart policy, but only after the interval you specify has elapsed.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1ProcedureLast" MadCap:autonum="●">Select <span class="Bold">Action repeat</span> if you want the action to be repeated on the mobile device after
the interval you specify for the number of times you specify.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can combine both of these options, if desired. For example, you could use both options to send a message to
mobile devices two hours after they join the policy
and every hour thereafter.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">Any delays and repetitions you specify apply to both existing and
future members of the smart policy. The delay for existing members is calculated from the
moment the action is assigned to the smart policy. A delayed or repeated action is not carried out on a mobile device if it is no
longer a member of the smart policy.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="7. ">Click <span class="Bold">Save</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="8. ">Click <span class="Bold">Done</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>

        <p class="Body">When you remove an action from a smart policy, any remaining repetitions or delayed executions of the action are not carried out.
