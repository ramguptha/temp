        <h1 class="Heading1">About the Self-Service Portal</h1>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is bundled with a Self-Service Portal that allows your device users to remotely manage computers and mobile devices enrolled under their account. Encouraging the use of the Self-Service Portal can empower your users to be more self-sufficient with resolving their own issues, potentially reducing the effort required for IT support.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">The management tasks that users can carry out in the Self-Service Portal vary by device platform and include the following:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Viewing detailed information about their device</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Locking their device to prevent unauthorized access</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Clearing and setting passcodes</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Sending messages to their device</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Erasing their device if it is lost or stolen</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Giving Users Access to the Self-Service Portal</h2>
        <p class="Body">Your device users must be considered "enrollment users" in Absolute Manage to use the Self-Service Portal. For information on importing enrollment users and enrolling their devices in Absolute Manage, see the <span class="Emphasis">Absolute Manage User Guide</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you decide you want to give your device users access to the Self-Service Portal, you must communicate the Portal's web address to them. This web address is typically as follows:&#160;https://&lt;address&gt;/mylogin/ (for example, https://amwebadmin.company.com/mylogin/). A direct link to the Self-Service Portal is also available at the bottom right of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> login page.</p>
        <p class="Body">You may also want to provide your device users with additional information on how to log in to the Self-Service Portal. After they log in, device users can access the Help to guide them through the steps of each task they can perform.</p>
