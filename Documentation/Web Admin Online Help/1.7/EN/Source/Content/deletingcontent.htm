        <h1 class="Heading1">Deleting Media Files</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can delete media files that have been imported into Absolute Manage. When you delete a media file, it is removed from any policies it may belong to and is no longer available to mobile device users through AbsoluteSafe. However, deleting a media file from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> does not remove any copies of the file that the user may have made  (if the file was allowed to leave AbsoluteSafe).</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To delete media files that have been imported into Absolute Manage:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to the <span class="Bold">Assignable Items</span> area.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Content</span>. (You can also  click <img src="Resources/Images/navicon.jpg" class="Icon"></img> in the top left corner of the screen and then click <span class="Bold">Mobile Content</span>.)</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">In the results grid, select the checkbox of the media files you want to delete and click <img src="Resources/Images/remove-button.png" class="Icon" />.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also delete a single media file from its Content Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the media file you want to delete. The file's Content Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) ">Click <span class="Bold">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Delete Content</span>.</p>
