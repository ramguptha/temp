        <h1 class="Heading1">Installing Configuration Profiles on Devices</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can remotely install existing configuration profiles on mobile devices. A configuration profile is an easy way of distributing common settings (for example, Wi-Fi, VPN, email, or application-specific settings) to the mobile devices in your deployment. Before you can install a configuration profile from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, you must import or create the profile using the Absolute Manage Admin interface. For more information, see "Working with configuration profiles" in the <span class="Emphasis">Absolute Manage User Guide</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you issue the command, the configuration profile is installed on the device as soon as it next contacts the notification server of its OS vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action
is usually carried out within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network.</p>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">Results of the profile installation vary slightly depending on the device's operating system:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">For iOS and Android devices, the profile is added to the existing profiles
installed on the device.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">For Windows Phone devices, the profile replaces the current
profile of the mailboxes that the selected devices are
synchronized with.
Because of the way Exchange ActiveSync works, this action also applies
the profile to all other devices that are synchronized with the
same Exchange mailboxes. (If such other devices are iOS
devices, the installed profile does not replace their current profiles, but
the profile’s settings may override those of any configuration
profiles installed on the devices.)</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To install configuration profiles on mobile devices:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the devices you want to install configuration profiles on. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All Windows Phone Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for specific devices</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the results grid, select the checkbox of each applicable device and click <span class="Bold">Commands</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">Install Configuration Profile</span>.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">If you are issuing the command to multiple devices at once, you must select devices of the same OS; that is, select all iOS&#160;devices, all Android devices, or all Windows Phone devices.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also issue the command for a single device from its Device Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the device you want to install configuration profiles on.  The device's Device Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) "> From the Commands sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Install Configuration Profile</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Select the checkboxes of the configuration profiles you want to install.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">To quickly find specific configuration profiles, you can use the search field to narrow the profiles listed by specific criteria (for example, by profile name or description).</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Install Profile</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
