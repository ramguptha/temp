        <h1 class="Heading1">Erasing Devices</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can remotely erase all user data on a mobile device as well as all applications the user has installed, effectively resetting the device to its factory condition.</p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum="WARNING! &#160;&#160;">This action is not reversible. You cannot recover the erased information from the mobile device (although recovering the
data from a backup system, if one exists within your organization, may be possible). Erasing a
device without the consent of the user may expose you to legal
liability.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you issue the command, a device is erased as soon as it next contacts the notification server of its OS vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action is
usually carried out within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network.</p>
        <p class="Body">After a device is erased, you can no longer administer that device through Absolute
Manage until you enroll it again or it has been completely
restored from a backup containing the Absolute
Manage enrollment profile.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To erase mobile devices:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the devices you want to erase. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All Mobile Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for specific devices</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the results grid, select the checkbox of each applicable device  and click <span class="Bold">Commands</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also issue the command for a single device from its Device Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the device you want to erase.  The device's Device Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) "> From the Commands sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">If any of the selected devices have internal SD&#160;cards, you are prompted to select one of the following options:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Erase internal storage only</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Erase internal storage and SD card</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Click <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span>.</p>
        <p class="Important_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="IMPORTANT &#160;&#160;">Clicking <span class="Bold">Erase Device</span> issues the command to erase data on the device, which you cannot reverse.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
