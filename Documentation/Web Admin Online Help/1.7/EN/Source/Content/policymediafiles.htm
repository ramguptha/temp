        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with Media Files Inside a Policy</h1>
        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">For iOS&#160;and Android devices, you can use media files within a policy in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●">Make media files available for on-demand installation within AbsoluteSafe by users of mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●">Automatically download media files through AbsoluteSafe to mobile devices that belong to the policy</p>
        <p class="Body">Mobile devices must have the AbsoluteSafe application installed in order for users to access media files made available to them through policies.</p>
        <p class="Body">Before you can add media files to a policy, you must <a href="importingmediafiles.htm">import the files into Absolute Manage</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Policy actions take place on any mobile device belonging to the
policy as soon as the device contacts the notification server of its OS&#160;vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action usually takes place within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network. You can <a href="sendingmessages.htm">send a message</a> to or email the users of the devices to notify them of
the availability of new media files.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding Media Files to a Policy</h2>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To add media files to a policy:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to the <span class="Bold">Mobile Policies</span> area.</p>

        <p class="Indent2">To quickly find specific media files, you can use the search field to narrow the files listed by specific criteria (for example, by file name or media category).</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="6. ">From the <span class="Bold">Assignment Rule</span> list, select how you want to manage the selected media files on devices belonging to the policy:</p>

the policy. The file remains on the device when it leaves the

        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">Use your local time in these fields. Times you enter are converted to and stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on the Absolute Manage server. As a result, you should take into account any time
differences that may exist with your mobile clients. You also must
manually compensate for Daylight Saving Time (DST), if desired,
because DST does not apply to UTC.</p>
