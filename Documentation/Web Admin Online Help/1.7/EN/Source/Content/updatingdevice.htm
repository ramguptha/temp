        <h1 class="Heading1">Updating Device Information</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can issue a command that queries devices and updates details about them (such as networking, storage, and hardware information) in the Absolute Manage database. The updated device information is then available in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">After you issue the command, a device is queried as soon as it next contacts the notification server of its OS vendor. If
the device is connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network, this action is
usually carried out within a minute; otherwise, it happens when the device
reconnects to a network.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To update device information in Absolute Manage:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the devices that you want to query. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All Mobile Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for specific devices</a>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In the results grid, select the checkbox of each applicable device and click <span class="Bold">Commands</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">Update Device Info</span>.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also issue the command for a single device from its Device Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the device you want to query. The device's Device Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) "> From the Commands sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Update Device Info</span>.</p>
        <p class="Steps" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to close the confirmation message.</p>
        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">You may need to click your browser's refresh button to see updated information within the results grid and the Device Details page.</p>
