        <p class="BodyWithListFollowing">You can view information about the commands that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> users have issued to mobile devices and computers within the following areas of the application:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Queued Commands</span>: Contains information related to
commands sent from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> that have not yet been carried out on the target devices and are still pending execution. A command may enter this queue because the target device is unavailable at the time  the command is initiated.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Last" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Command History</span>: Contains information related to
commands sent from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> that have been completed (successfully or unsuccessfully) on the target devices. If there were any errors during the execution of a command, they show on this page.</p>
