        <h1 class="Heading1">Setting Activation Lock Options</h1>
        <p class="Body">Devices running iOS 7 and higher include the Activation Lock feature, which is part of Apple's Find My iPhone service. The Activation Lock feature requires the input of the device user's Apple
ID and password before a device can be reactivated or erased.</p>
        <p class="Body">By default, the Activation Lock feature  is not active on supervised devices when
Find My iPhone is turned on.
You can choose whether you want the feature to be enabled or disabled on a device when Find My iPhone is turned on.</p>
        <p class="Body">This command applies only to supervised devices running
iOS 7 or higher.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">You cannot disable the Activation Lock feature using this command if the feature is currently enabled on a device. For information on disabling the Activation Lock feature when it is currently enabled on a device, see "Disabling the activation lock when it is already active" in the <span class="Emphasis">Absolute Manage User Guide</span>.</p>
        <p class="TaskIntro">To set Activation Lock options on supervised devices running iOS 7 and higher:</p>
        <p class="Step1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Navigate to a page in the Mobile Devices area that contains the devices you want to set Activation Lock options on. For example, you can navigate to <span class="Bold">Mobile Devices</span> &gt; <span class="Bold">All iOS Devices</span>, then <a href="searchingforinfo.htm">search for specific devices</a>.</p>

        <p class="Note_Procedure" MadCap:autonum="NOTE &#160;&#160;">If you are issuing the command to multiple devices at once, all  selected devices must be supervised devices running iOS 7 or higher.</p>
        <p class="Indent2">You can also issue the command for a single device from its Device Details page:</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="a) ">In the results grid, click the device whose Activation Lock options you want to set. The device's Device Details page opens.</p>
        <p class="SubSteps" MadCap:autonum="b) "> From the Commands sidebar, click <span class="Bold">Set Activation Lock Options</span>.</p>

        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Allow Activation</span>: Whenever Find My iPhone is enabled on the selected devices, the Activation Lock feature will also be enabled.
Whenever Find My iPhone is disabled, the Activation
Lock feature will also be disabled.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1Procedure" MadCap:autonum="●"><span class="Bold">Disallow Activation</span>:The Activation Lock feature can no longer be enabled on the
selected devices. It will remain off regardless of whether Find My iPhone is turned on. However, if the Activation Lock feature is currently enabled on
a selected device, it will remain enabled.</p>
