        <p class="BodyFollowingListWithListFollowing">There are two types of policies you can use to automate mobile device administration:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●"><a href="creatingpolicies.htm">Standard policy</a>: Allows you to manually add and remove specific mobile devices to and from the policy. The list of devices in a standard policy remains the same until you change it.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="●"><a href="creatingsmartpolicies.htm">Smart policy</a>: Allows you to set filter criteria that determine which mobile devices should be included in the policy. The list of devices in a smart policy is automatically updated on the fly when devices satisfy the filter criteria you have chosen. You cannot manually add or remove specific mobile devices to and from the policy.</p>
