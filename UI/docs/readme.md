Readme
======

This is the documentation repository for all client UI code. For now, please fill it with "cookbook" style text files that describe to solve a particular problem, or accomplish a particular task. At some point, we will build a nicer way to present and browse them, but for now the goal is simply to have something written.

App Server startup and deployment:
----------------------------------

You can start the server with alternate location of "packages" library on a different port like this:

    node app --p=3001

Both flags above are optional.
