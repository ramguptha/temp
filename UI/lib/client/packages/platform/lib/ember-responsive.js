  /**
   * This is the main entry point to `Ember.Responsive`, and all it does
   * is take care of configuring this library to your specifications before
   * spinning up your Ember app.
   *
   * **Setting media for your application**
   *
   * Presently, you can easily configure your application's breakpoints
   * using media queries.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * var App = Ember.Application.extend();
   *
   * // Declare the media that we care about.
   * App.responsive({
  *   media: {
  *     mobile:  '(max-width: 768px)',
  *     tablet:  '(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px)',
  *     desktop: '(min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px)',
  *     jumbo:   '(min-width: 1201px)',
  *   }
  * });
   * ```
   *
   * After you've gone through this process, you'll be able to access
   * the media queries in a few different places of your application:
   *
   *   - All controllers, under the name `media`.
   *   - All components, under the name `media`.
   *   - All views, under the name `media`.
   *   - All routes, under the name `media`.
   *   - In the container, under the name `responsive:media`.
   *
   * **Binding media classes to your application view**
   *
   * `Ember.Responsive` makes it very easy to bind the active media queries as
   * class names on your app view (or any view, for that matter). This helps you
   * avoid having to duplicate media queries in your CSS and Ember code, and
   * makes writing responsive CSS much simpler.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({
  *   classNameBindings: ['media.classNames']
  * });
   * ```
   *
   * **Referencing media queries in your app**
   *
   * `Ember.Responsive` also allows access to its API in controllers, components,
   * routes, and views, making it dead simple to only perform certain types of
   * work for certain devices.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * App.PostsRoute = Ember.Router.extend({
  *   model: function() {
  *     if (this.get('media.isMobile')) {
  *       // Return a smaller, less data-hungry result
  *     }
  *   }
  * });
   * ```
   *
   * **Referencing media queries in your templates**
   *
   * Since media queries are available in your controllers, components,
   * and views, they'll also be accessible in your templates.
   *
   * ```handlebars
   * \{{#if media.isMobile}}
   *    Mobile view!
   * \{{/if}}
   * ```
   *
   * **Mocking a particular media type in test**
   *
   * It's very easy to fake a particular view when testing as well. This
   * is useful when you want to be able to test different behaviours
   * for different types of devices.
   *
   * If you're writing an integration test, you'll probably want to mock
   * out the media type at the application level.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * App.responsive({
  *   media: {
  *     mobile: 'all' // The 'all' media query will always match
  *   }
  * });
   * ```
   *
   * But in unit tests, you can simply override the property that you're
   * referencing.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * controller.set('media.isMobile', true);
   * ```
   *
   * Refer to the {{#crossLink "Ember.Responsive.Media"}}{{/crossLink}}
   * documentation for more examples of how to interact with the
   * aforementioned `media` object.

(function(Ember) {
  /**
   * Handles detecting and responding to media queries.
   *
   * Generally speaking, you won't ever need to create an instance of this class
   * yourself, since `Ember.Responsive` takes care of creating and configuring it
   * for you. However, it is important to document how to interact with this
   * classâ€”which can become important during test time in particular. With that
   * said, let's take a look at how to work with it.
   *
   * **Adding media query matchers**
   *
   * The first step to using the class is to add media queries that you
   * want it to listen to. Each media query has a name that you can
   * use to reference it by.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * media = Ember.Responsive.Media.create();
   * media.match('mobile', '(max-width: 768px)');
   * media.match('desktop', '(min-width: 769px)');
   * ```
   *
   * **Testing the media query matchers**
   *
   * Now that you've added a few matchers, you can access those media queries as
   * if they were properties on your object. The nice thing is that whenever the
   * media queries change, this class will automatically update the relevant
   * properties (and so will the rest of your application, thanks to the power
   * of two-way data-binding).
   *
   * ```javascript
   * media = Ember.Responsive.Media.create();
   * media.match('mobile', '(max-width: 768px)');
   * media.match('desktop', '(min-width: 769px)');
   *
   * // There are convenient "isser" properties defined...
   * if (media.get('isMobile')) {
  *   console.log('mobile!');
  * }
   *
   * // As well as access to the matchMedia API...
   * if (media.get('desktop.matches')) {
  *   console.log('desktop!');
  * }
   * ```
   *
   * **Retrieving a list of matching media queries**
   *
   * It's also nice to be able to see which media queries are matching, since
   * some applications might have many matches at the same time.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * media = Ember.Responsive.Media.create();
   * media.match('desktop', 'all');
   * media.match('mobile', 'all');
   *
   * console.log(media.get('matches'));
   * // => Ember.Set(['desktop', 'mobile']);
   * ```
   *
   * This class can also return that list as a string of dasherized class names,
   * which is useful for placing on your app's rootElement. By default, these
   * class names are prefixed with `media-`, so as not to clash with any other
   * classes your app might use.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({
  *   classNameBindings: ['media.classNames']
  * });
   * ```
   *
   * @module    ember-responsive
   * @namespace Ember.Responsive
   * @class     Media
   * @extends   Ember.Object

        }
      }
      this.get('listeners')[name] = listener;

      if (matcher.addListener) {
        matcher.addListener(function(matcher){
          Ember.run(null, listener, matcher);
        });
      }
      listener(matcher);
    }
  });
